## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### SQL Analysis Framework
```sql
-- Example: Attrition Rate by Department
WITH department_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        department,
        COUNT(*) as total_employees,
        SUM(CASE WHEN attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as departed_employees
    FROM employee_data
    GROUP BY department
)
SELECT 
    department,
    total_employees,
    departed_employees,
    ROUND((departed_employees * 100.0 / total_employees), 2) as attrition_rate
FROM department_stats
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;
```

### Python Analysis Pipeline
```python
# Employee Attrition Analysis Pipeline
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load and analyze data
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample/employee_data.csv')

# Calculate attrition rates
attrition_rate = df.groupby('Department')['Attrition'].apply(
    lambda x: (x == 'Yes').sum() / len(x) * 100
).sort_values(ascending=False)

# Visualize results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
attrition_rate.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Attrition Rate by Department')
plt.ylabel('Attrition Rate (%)')
plt.show()
```
