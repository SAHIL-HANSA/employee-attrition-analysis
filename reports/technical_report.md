## Key Findings

### Primary Risk Factors (Ranked by Impact)

1. **Job Satisfaction (β = -0.89, p < 0.001)**
   - Strongest predictor of attrition
   - 1-point increase reduces attrition odds by 59%
   - Critical threshold: Satisfaction ≤ 2

2. **Years at Company (β = 0.67, p < 0.001)**
   - Non-linear relationship (peak risk at 2-3 years)
   - Early career transition period most vulnerable
   - Stabilizes after 5 years

3. **Work-Life Balance (β = -0.54, p < 0.001)**
   - Strong negative correlation with attrition
   - Particularly critical for high performers
   - Interaction effect with overtime requirements

4. **Department (β varies, p < 0.05)**
   - IT: Highest risk (OR = 2.3)
   - Sales: Second highest (OR = 2.1)
   - HR: Lowest risk (reference group)

5. **Performance Rating (β = 0.31, p < 0.05)**
   - Paradoxical positive relationship
   - High performers more likely to leave
   - Indicates retention challenge for top talent

### Demographic Insights

# Logistic regression equation
log_odds = -2.134 + (-0.892 * job_satisfaction) + 
           (-0.543 * work_life_balance) + 
           (0.312 * performance_rating) + 
           (0.089 * age) + 
           (department_dummies)
```

3. Department (0.198)
4. Years at Company (0.143)
5. Performance Rating (0.060)

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

#### High-Risk Employee Identification
```python
def calculate_risk_score(employee):
    score = 0
    
    # Job satisfaction weight (30%)
    if job_satisfaction <= 2:
        score += 30
    elif job_satisfaction == 3:
        score += 15
    
    # Work-life balance weight (25%)
    if work_life_balance <= 2:
        score += 25
    elif work_life_balance == 3:
        score += 12
    
    # Tenure weight (25%)
    if 1 <= years_at_company <= 3:
        score += 25
    elif years_at_company < 1:
        score += 15
    
    # Performance weight (20%)
    if performance_rating >= 4:
        score += 20  # High performers at risk
    
    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100
```
